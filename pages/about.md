## About the Collection Builder CDM Skin

This demo collection features works of art from the collection of the [Weisman Museum of Art Collection](https://cdm15730.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15730coll35) at Pepperdine University, and is built using [CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh) 

CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm is a template for creating digital collection exhibits on top of existing CONTENTdm repositories. The demo collection features images, document pdfs, audio, and YouTube video items to demonstrate the range of possibilities using the CollectionBuilder visualizations.

Items from this collection are non-professional digital captures of artwork from Pepperdine University’s Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art. To request more information about any of the featured works of art, please contact **museum@pepperdine.edu** Visit the [Weisman Museum’s website](https://arts.pepperdine.edu/museum/) to learn more about the museum and their current exhibitions.
